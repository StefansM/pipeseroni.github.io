{"name":"Pipeseroni","tagline":"Gorgeous Terminal Screensavers","body":"## Welcome to Pipeseroni!\r\nWe make gorgeous terminal screensavers, the most well known of which is [pipes.sh](https://pipeseroni.github.io/pipes.sh). We also have a few other programs which are either versions in different languages or idea which build on the core pipes concept. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n### List of Programs\r\nHere's a list of all the programs which are maintained as part of Pipeseroni\r\n\r\n| Program | Language | Description |\r\n| :-------: | :--------: | :----------- |\r\n| [pipes.sh](https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.sh) | Bash | the original script |\r\n| [Snakes](https://github.com/pipeseroni/Snakes) | C | a version written in C |\r\n| [snakes.pl](https://github.com/pipeseroni/snakes.pl) | Perl | a version written in Perl |\r\n| [pipesX.sh](https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipesX.sh) | Bash | original pipes, but this time diagonal |\r\n| [weave.sh](https://github.com/pipeseroni/weave.sh) | Bash | inject some mathematics into your pipes |\r\n\r\n### A Brief History\r\npipes.sh was originally created by [Matthew Simpson](@msimpson) and posted to the [Arch Linux Forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=728932#p728932) in early 2010. It was also later posted to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/msimpson/1096939) released in the public domain.\r\n\r\nIn early 2013 [Yu-Jie Lin](@livibetter) posted a modification of the script to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/livibetter/4689307) after reading about it on a [blog](http://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/pipes-sh-a-little-bit-of-fun/). It was maintained on Gist independently for a period of a few months.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 the script was given its own GitHub repo which encouraged contributions from other developers. As the script gained more popularity the decision was made to combine forces with developers of similar projects (such as this [C version](https://github.com/pipeseroni/Snakes)).\r\n\r\nFinally, in 2015 the MIT license was added and the [Pipeseroni](https://github.com/pipeseroni) collective was formed. Matthew and Yu-Jie have since left the project and it is now maintained by [Joshua Fogg](@Foggalong) and @OneLastTry.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
